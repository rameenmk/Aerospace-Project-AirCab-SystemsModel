## 📊 Project Management Structure

## 🧩 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

![](wbs.png)

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) above presents a hierarchical decomposition of the **Air Cab project’s internal systems**, enabling modular planning, parallel execution, and milestone-based delivery. It breaks down complex subsystems into smaller, manageable components across all major domains:

### 📂 Hierarchical Decomposition Across:
- **Propulsion Systems** – motor architecture, system integration, and testing
- **Structures** – cabin layout, materials, manufacturing, and ergonomic design
- **Avionics** – flight control computers, sensors, and human-machine interface
- **Software & Safety Systems** – embedded logic, temperature control, redundancy features

Each component follows a development lifecycle:
- **Design:** Initial engineering design, ergonomics, control architecture
- **Build:** Manufacturing, installation of structural and system elements
- **TI (Test & Integration):** Structural tests, airflow analysis, software testing
- **Delivery:** Certification, C&C, maintenance guides, and system integration

This WBS structure is used to plan timelines in **Microsoft Project**, and supports **Agile sprint-based execution** in software and avionics subsystems, alongside traditional systems engineering in hardware modules.

### 🗓️ Schedule Planning
![](scheduling.png)
The Air Cab project was structured using Microsoft Project to manage timelines, dependencies, and engineering milestones. A combination of traditional systems engineering and Agile practices was followed for iterative development within subsystems.

- Lifecycle: Concept → Design → Prototype → Test → Certification
- Parallel workstreams (e.g., propulsion, avionics, chassis)
- Agile-inspired sprints for software modules
- MS Project used for WBS, Gantt charts, and long-term planning  
- Covers conceptual design to flight certification
